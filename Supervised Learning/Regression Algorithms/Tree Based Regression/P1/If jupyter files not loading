Due to a stupid github bug sometimes you can't access the jupyter notebooks.

So if you see an "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" error just copy the file's url like: 
https://github.com/sachink1729/RegressionAlgorithms/blob/main/LassoRegressionMPG.ipynb 

go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the file's url there to see it.

OR

you can download the entire folder to and use anaconda3 Jupyter Notebook viewer to access all the files.
